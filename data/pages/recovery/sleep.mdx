# Growth Hormones
During different sleep stages, the body experiences significant releases of it's growth hormone. This hormone is a powerful stimulator of muscle repair and growth. Without sufficient sleep, the body's ability to produce it's growth hormone is compromised, limiting muscle recovery and making it a challenge to achieve your desired goals. 

Sleep is also responsible for other hormones, and without it your body leaves homeostasis. Sleep deprivation has been correlated with increased levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, which has been shown to break down muscle tissue and hamper muscle growth. On the other hand, adequate sleep triggers testosterone production, a hormone vital for muscle development

# Sleep Debt
Consistently getting inadequate sleep accumulates a sleep debt. Sleep debts are almost impossible to "pay off", but consistent quality sleep over a few days or a few weeks will help restore your body.

A sleep debt can lead to fatigue, decreased cognitive performance, impaired concentration, mood disturbances, increased risk of accidents, and compromised physical health. It can also impact physical and mental recovery,
as it has been linked to a significant decrease protein synthesis. During sleep, specifically the deep sleep stage, the body utilizes proteins for muscle repair and growth. Without adequate sleep, your body lacks the time it needs to effectively repair and build muscle. 

# Energy
Sleep also effects energy levels throughout the day. When you are sleep deprived, your body's performance is going to be significantly decreased, leading to suboptimal results in the gym. Being well rested enables you to train with a higher intensity and push your body farther than you could while sleep deprived.

# Physical Recovery
Sleep contributes to physical recovery in a few different ways. It helps reduce inflammation caused by natural physical stress, but it can become chronic and hinder recovery if not managed. While sleeping your body also repairs tissues and minor injuries / strains. This process is crucial for the health of your muscles, tendons, ligaments, and other various tissues. 

During sleep, the body clears out built up lactic acid collected during physical activity. Lactic acid buildup is a common cause of muscle soreness, meaning sleep can alleviate your soreness and discomfort, allowing for a more comfortable recovery.
