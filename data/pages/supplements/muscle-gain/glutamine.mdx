# What is Glutamine?
Glutamine is an amino acid that is naturally produced in the body and is involved in several essential bodily functions. It is also found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and dairy products.

As a workout supplement, glutamine has gained popularity among athletes and bodybuilders for its potential benefits in promoting muscle growth and recovery. Glutamine is a key component of muscle tissue, and supplementing with it may help promote muscle protein synthesis, reduce muscle breakdown, and improve muscle recovery after exercise. Additionally, glutamine has been shown to enhance glycogen resynthesis, which can help replenish energy stores after intense workouts.

Aside from its potential benefits for muscle growth and recovery, glutamine may also support overall immune function, gut health, and wound healing. Glutamine is essential for the proper functioning of immune cells, and supplementing with it may help strengthen the body's immune response. Additionally, glutamine is involved in the maintenance of the intestinal lining, which can help improve gut health and reduce inflammation. Moreover, glutamine is involved in the synthesis of collagen, a protein that is critical for wound healing and tissue repair.

# Timing/Dosage of Consumption
The most common dosages of Glutamine are around 5-10g, but it depends on a variety of factors, including weight, age, and activity level.

As for timing, there is no specific time of day when glutamine should be taken. It can be consumed at any time, either with or without food. Some studies suggest that consuming glutamine immediately after a workout may help enhance muscle recovery and growth. However, other studies suggest that taking glutamine before bedtime may help improve protein synthesis and reduce muscle breakdown during the overnight fasting period.

Overall, the best approach is to follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and timing or consult with a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations based on individual needs and goals.
