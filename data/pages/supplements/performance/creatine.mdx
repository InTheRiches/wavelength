# What is Creatine?
Creatine is produced from amino acids, primarily in the liver, but also in smaller quantities in the kidneys and pancreas. It functions as a reservoir for high-energy phosphate groups in the form of phosphocreatine, which can be contributed to ADP (depleted ATP) converting into ATP, the primary energy carrier in the body. This means that Creatine can convert energy depleted ADP, into energy full ATP. This function is especially significant in circumstances of high energy demands, such as intense physical or mental exertion. Creatine also improves the function of transport proteins, increasing water reserves in muscles. This leads to fuller, more muscular look while staying lean. Creatine is abundant in animal-based meals, with meat and fish being the most common sources. It is most commonly supplemented in powder form.

# Why should you take it?
Creatine is a supplement built for athletes. It extends exertion periods and delays fatigue, and enhances high-intensity, short-duration activities like weightlifting, sprinting, and jumping. It can improve muscle strength and endurance output, allowing you to lift heavier weights or perform more explosive movements. It also stores water in the muscle tissue, causing the muscles to appear fuller and bigger than they would otherwise. This can make your physique look more impressive and aesthetic.

Remember, creatine is a non-essential supplement. You can achieve your fitness goals without, and only assists you along the way. Creatine does not instantly make you stronger, you still have to put in the work to see results. Creatine is a great option for athletes and bodybuilders, and is one of the most effective supplements on the market.

# Timing/Dosage of Consumption
The appropriate time and dosage of creatine consumption depends on a variety of factors, including an individual's body weight, physical activity, and overall health. In general, a typical creatine supplementation protocol involves an initial "loading phase" of 20-25 grams per day for 5-7 days, followed by a "maintenance phase" of 3-5 grams per day for several weeks or months. The loading phase is not necessary, and only hastens the saturation of creatine. In most cases, just starting with the maintenance dose will suffice, and after around a month, you will be fully saturated. The time of consumption doesn't matter, but people often take it at night or in the morning.

<InformationBlock content="Creatine intake should always be accompanied by adequate hydration, as it can cause an increase in water retention. Additionally, consulting with a healthcare professional or a sports nutritionist is recommended to determine the most appropriate creatine supplementation plan for an individual's needs and goals."/>

# What brands are best?
Creatine is a simple product, and you don't need to pay top dollar to get some fancy version. Monohydrate is typically the cheapest, and since all types are effectively the same, Monohydrate is typically the best choice.
