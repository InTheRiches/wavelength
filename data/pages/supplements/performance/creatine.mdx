# Why should you take it?
Creatine is a supplement built for athletes. It extends exertion periods and delays fatigue, and enhances high-intensity, short-duration activities like weightlifting, sprinting, and jumping. It can improve muscle strength and endurance output, allowing you to lift heavier weights or perform more explosive movements. It also stores water in the muscle tissue, causing the muscles to appear fuller and bigger than they would otherwise. This can make your physique look more impressive and aesthetic.

Remember, creatine is a non-essential supplement. You can achieve your fitness goals without, and only assists you along the way. Creatine does not instantly make you stronger, you still have to put in the work to see results. Creatine is a great option for athletes and bodybuilders, and is one of the most effective supplements on the market.

# Timing/Dosage of Consumption
The appropriate time and dosage of creatine consumption depends on a variety of factors, including an individual's body weight, physical activity, and overall health. In general, a typical creatine supplementation protocol involves an initial "loading phase" of 20-25 grams per day for 5-7 days, followed by a "maintenance phase" of 3-5 grams per day for several weeks or months. The loading phase is not necessary, and only hastens the saturation of creatine. In most cases, just starting with the maintenance dose will suffice, and after around a month, you will be fully saturated. The time of consumption doesn't matter, but people often take it at night or in the morning.

<InformationBlock content="Creatine intake should always be accompanied by adequate hydration, as it can cause an increase in water retention. Additionally, consulting with a healthcare professional or a sports nutritionist is recommended to determine the most appropriate creatine supplementation plan for an individual's needs and goals."/>
