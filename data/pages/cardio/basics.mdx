# What is Cardio?
Cardio, short for **cardiovascular exercise**, refers to any exercise that increases your **heart rate**, **breathing rate**, and **strengthens** your heart and lungs. Cardio exercises are an important part of a healthy lifestyle and can provide numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, weight loss, improved mood, and reduced risk of chronic diseases.

Examples of cardio exercises include running, cycling, swimming, and walking. These activities can be done at varying levels of **intensity**, depending on your fitness level and goals. For example, a beginner might start with a 20-minute walk at a moderate pace, while someone more experienced might do a **high-intensity interval training** (HIIT) workout that includes short bursts of all-out effort followed by periods of [active recovery](/recovery/basics#active-recovery).

When you perform cardiovascular exercises such as running, swimming, or cycling, your heart needs to work harder to pump oxygenated blood to your muscles. This increased demand on the heart leads to an adaptation response, causing the heart muscle to become **stronger** and more **efficient** over time. A stronger heart can pump blood more effectively with each beat, which ultimately lowers the heart rate at rest. The same is true with the lungs, the consistent demand of oxygen results in growth and adaptation. This can lead to stronger, more efficient lungs, increasing capacity.

The [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults) recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio exercise per week, in addition to muscle-strengthening activities at least two days per week.

# Why Cardio?
When you perform cardiovascular exercises such as running, swimming, or cycling, your heart needs to work harder to pump oxygenated blood to your muscles. This increased demand on the heart leads to adaptations, causing the heart muscle to become **stronger** and more **efficient** over time. By strengthening your heart muscle, it improves **blood circulation** and enhances your overall **cardiovascular health**. This can reduce the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, and improve cholesterol levels. The same is true with the lungs. The consistent demand of oxygen results in strengthening and adaptation. This can lead to stronger, more efficient lungs, increasing capacity.

By challenging your cardiovascular system and improving its efficiency, you can sustain physical activity for longer periods without feeling excessively tired. This extended **endurance** can be beneficial for various activities, such as sports, recreational pursuits, or daily tasks that require prolonged physical exertion.

Cardiovascular exercise stimulates the release of **endorphins**, often referred to as **"feel-good"** hormones. These endorphins can contribute to a sense of well-being, reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and help manage stress. Engaging in cardio workouts can provide a natural mood boost and help you unwind after a long day.

<InformationBlock content="It is important to note that while cardio exercises can be a great way to improve your health and fitness, they should be done in conjunction with a balanced diet and strength training program for optimal results. It is also important to consult your doctor before starting a new exercise program, particularly if you have any underlying health conditions." />

# Weight Loss
blah blah blah

<WarningBlock content="The idea of losing fat in specific areas through targeted exercises (also known as spot fat reduction), is a common fitness misconception. The body does not selectively burn fat from targeted areas during exercise. For example, if you're doing ab crunches, you will not lose fat in your abdomen. Your body pulls fat from all accross the body, and it depends heavily on genetics. Instead, achieving overall fat loss requires a broader approach involving a balanced diet, regular cardio, and strength training to keep a caloric deficit and promote fat reduction." />
