  "description": "This is a full body 3x a week routine. This is for anyone who has never touched a barbell before or is very new in their lifting journey. Repeat this 3x a week with at least 1 rest day between each session. You will learn every important movement pattern: horizontal push, knee flexion, vertical pull, hip hinge, vertical push, horizontal row. with some optional isolation work. Look up proper form on all movements and avoid lifting too heavy (ego lifting) as to avoid injury."
