  "title": "Infraspinatus",
  "description": "The infraspinatus is one of the four muscles that make up the [rotator cuff](/muscles/specifics/back/rotator-cuff) in the shoulder. It is located on the **posterior** (back) aspect of the shoulder blade (scapula) and attaches to the greater tubercle of the humerus (upper arm bone). The infraspinatus works together with the other rotator-cuff muscles to stabilize and control the movement of the shoulder joint."
