  "title": "Rotator Cuff",
  "description": "The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles and their tendons that surround the shoulder joint. It includes the supraspinatus, [infraspinatus](/muscles/specifics/back/infraspinatus), [teres minor](/muscles/specifics/back/teres), and subscapularis. The primary function of the rotator cuff is to provide stability to the shoulder, facilitate smooth and controlled movements, and help maintain proper alignment of the humeral head within the shoulder socket. The rotator cuff plays a crucial role in preventing dislocations."
