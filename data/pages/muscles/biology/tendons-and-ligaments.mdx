# Ligaments
Ligaments are bands of connective tissue connecting bones to one another. Ligaments provide stability to the joints by holding them together and preventing excessive or abnormal movement. They act like strong ropes, keeping the bones in proper alignment while allowing controlled and safe movement. 

Ligaments, being tough bands of connective tissue, have a certain degree of strength and elasticity. However, compared to muscles, ligaments have a relatively limited capacity to strengthen and adapt. Unlike muscles, which can increase in size and strength with regular exercise, ligaments have a more limited ability to undergo significant changes in strength.
That being said, there are ways to promote the health and stability of ligaments. One important aspect is maintaining overall joint health. Strengthening the muscles surrounding a joint can provide added support and stability, which can indirectly benefit the ligaments. By strengthening the muscles, you can help stabilize the joint and reduce the stress placed on the ligaments.

# Tendons
Tendons are tough bands of connective tissue that attach muscles to bones. They serve as the link between muscles and bones, transmitting the force generated by the muscles to the bones. Tendons are incredibly strong and can withstand the tension produced by contracting muscles. Muscles attach to tendons which then attach to bones. 

Tendons, being connective tissue rather than muscle tissue, have a limited capacity for growth. You cannot target tendons individually, but they are strengthened by performing any exercise. By growing and strengthening muscles, the corresponding tendons are also strengthened. Tendons are slower to adapt, and can result in injury if you push your body past its limits.
