# Why do Muscles Grow?
Your body is built to **adapt**, and your muscles are no exception. When challenged through an activity like weightlifting, the muscles grow and strengthen to combat the new challenge and demand. 

During physical activities such as weightlifting, muscles experience stress and damage at the cellular level. This stress doesn't necessarily result in "micro-tears" as commonly described but does trigger a process of adaptation. The stress on muscles leads to an increase in the synthesis of new muscle proteins. Over time, this increased protein synthesis, coupled with proper nutrition and rest, can lead to muscle growth and increased strength. This process is called muscle [hypertrophy](/muscles/training/styles/hypertrophy) (hy·per·tro·phy), and it's how muscles grow.

# How to Optimize Growth
There are 3 main factors that contribute to muscle growth; mechanical tension; metabolic stress; and muscle damage. Mechanical tension has the most effect, and primarily increases strength over **CSA** (cross sectional area). Metabolic stress plays a larger role in **hypertrophy**, and is correlated to significant increases in CSA. Maximizing mechanical tension and metabolic stress will provide the best results, and should be the primary focus when designing your program.

Outside of training, your diet and sleep play huge roles in your progress. Without proper nutrition and sleep routines, your workout's won't be effect. For more information, visit [dieting](/dieting/basics) and [sleep](/recovery/sleep).

# Mechanical Tension
Mechanical tension is the force induced on your muscles that tries to **stretch** them during exercise. It can trigger multiple process's and molecular pathways inside muscle cells, such as the mTOR pathway that induces protein synthesis. Mechanical tension can also trigger satellite cell activation, which are stem cells that can fuse with existing muscle fibers and donate their nuclei. This can increase the protein capacity of muscle fibers, allowing them to produce more protein and grow bigger.

# Metabolic Stress
Metabolic stress is the physiological effects of exercise on the metabolism of the body. When your muscles contract, they require **adenosine triphosphate** (ATP), which is the body's primary energy transporter. The most efficient way to get ATP, by breaking down glucose into H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> (cellular respiration), requires oxygen, which is not always available.

Your body substitutes with **fermentation**, which does not require oxygen. As a compromise, it only partially breaks down glucose, which produces byproducts such as lactate (lactic acid), hydrogen ions, and inorganic phosphate. These byproducts can accumulate in the muscles and the blood, impacting the function of your body and trigger various adaptations, such as increased blood flow and horomone release.

Your body is really good at clearing this lactic acid out, but it often cannot keep up during high intensity activities. This results in a **buildup** of lactic acid, which can cause a burning sensation within the muscle and the **classic "pump" feeling**. However, lactic acid is not the cause of muscle soreness, but rather a byproduct of the process, and is cleared out of the muscles within an hour or two.

Metabolic stress in induced during exercise with higher repetitions, shorter rest periods, and longer time under tension. Hypertrophy training attempts to **optimize metabolic stress**, and maximize muscle CSA.

# Strength Training
Strength training prioritizes mechanical tension, and according to [Krzysztofik et al. (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/): "RT with high-loads (>85% 1RM), and a low number of repetitions (1−5) as well as long rest intervals (~3−5 min) is largely oriented toward a greater magnitude of mechanical tension, which primarily develops strength, while muscle hypertrophy is compromised". Learn more about strength training [here](/muscles/training/styles/strength).

# Hypertrophy Training
While high loads and long rest intervals cause mechanical tension, higher volume and smaller loads, combined with shorter rests elicits metabolic stress, the main factor in muscle hypertrophy. According to [Krzysztofik et al. (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/): "Implementation of training with moderate number of repetitions (~6−12), multiple sets (3−6), moderate loads (60−80% 1RM), and short rest intervals (60 s) between sets elicits greater metabolic stress (in contrast with high-loads), which appears to be a potent stimulus for inducing muscle hypertrophy".
