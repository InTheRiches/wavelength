# Terminology
--- - **Repetition ([Learn More](muscles/training/basics/reps-and-sets#reps-and-sets))**:A repetition, or rep for short, is a single movement of an exercise. For example, a single push up is one repetition. A rep is the most basic form of measurement in weight lifting.
- **Set ([Learn More](muscles/training/basics/reps-and-sets#reps-and-sets))**A set is a group of repetitions. For example, a set would be 10 push ups performed in succession. If the reps were not performed in succession, it would typically not be a set.
- **Weight**Weight refers to the amount of resistance used in an exercise. This can be in the form of dumbbells, barbells, or even body weight.
- **Volume ([Learn More](muscles/training/basics/concepts#volume))**Volume refers to the total amount of work performed during a workout. It is a combination of the number of sets, repetitions, and weight or resistance used in an exercise.
- **1RM**1RM, or one rep max, is the maximum amount of weight you can lift for a single repetition of an exercise. It is used to determine the amount of weight you should use for a given exercise. It is important you accurately track this, and make sure you are at true muscular failure.---

# Volume
**Volume**, in the context of exercise, refers to the total amount of work performed during a workout. It is a combination of the number of sets, repetitions, and weight or resistance used in an exercise. Calculating volume helps you quantify the overall workload you're subjecting your muscles to, which can be useful for tracking progress and designing **effective training programs**.

To calculate volume, multiply the number of sets by the number of repetitions performed in each set, and then multiply that by the weight used. The formula for volume is:

`Volume = Sets × Repetitions × Weight`
For example, if you perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions of bench press with a weight of 50 pounds, the volume would be:

`Volume = 3 sets × 10 reps × 50 pounds = 1500 pounds`
Calculating volume can help you track your progress over time. By gradually increasing the volume, either by adding more sets, repetitions, or weight, you can apply the principle of progressive overload and stimulate muscle growth and adaptation. However, it's important to progress gradually and listen to your body to **avoid overtraining and injuries**.

# Tracking Progression
Tracking progress in the gym is an important part of achieving your fitness goals. By keeping track of your workouts, including your set and rep counts, you can **monitor your progress**, make adjustments to your routine, and stay motivated. By tracking your [set and rep](/muscles/training/basics/reps-and-sets) counts over time, you can see how your strength and endurance are improving. This can help you stay motivated, especially on days when you may not feel as strong or motivated.

Tracking your set and rep counts can also help you set [realistic goals](/getting-started/introduction) for yourself. For example, if you're currently doing 3 sets of 8 reps for a certain exercise, you can aim to increase that to 3 sets of 10 reps or more over time. Set goals above what you think you can do, and **push yourself every set**. The human body is far more capable than most people think. When the average person thinks they can't go further, **they still have 40% left in the tank**. Try and unlock that 40% as you progress. Make sure to steadily increase [volume](/muscles/training/basics/concepts#volume) by increasing any of the contributing factors: reps, sets, and weight.

If you're not seeing the progress you want, tracking your set and rep counts can help you identify where you might need to **make adjustments to your routine**. For example, if you're stuck at a certain weight or rep count, you may want to apply [shocking techniques](/muscles/training/basics/concepts#shocking-the-muscle) to reset your muscles.

There are many ways to track your set and rep counts, including using a fitness journal, a mobile app, or simply keeping track of your progress in a spreadsheet. The important thing is to find a method that works for you and to be [consistent](/getting-started/introduction#embrace-consistency) with it.

# Progressive Overload
Progressive overload is a principle in exercise that involves gradually increasing the demands on your muscles to **promote growth and improvement**. By consistently increasing demand on your muscles, they are forced to adapt and grow.

The most basic way to apply progressive overload is by [increasing volume](/muscles/training/basics/concepts#volume). This can be done by increasing the **number of sets, repetitions, or weight** used in an exercise. Every workout you should strive to increase volume in one of those 3 ways. This continually pressures the muscles to grow, and is the most effective way to build muscle. There are other pathways to take, including rest times and workout frequency. However, these do not always lead to muscle growth, and may **end up causing overtraining and injury**. Make sure to listen to your body, and progress gradually.

# Shocking the Muscle
Shocking the muscle, also known as muscle confusion or muscle variation, is a technique used in weightlifting to prevent the body from adapting to a particular exercise routine. The idea behind shocking the muscle is that by performing different exercises at different rep and weight counts, you can stimulate muscle growth and avoid hitting a plateau in your progress.

The principle behind muscle shocking is rooted in the concept of the **General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)**, which states that the body will adapt to a specific stressor over time, leading to a plateau in progress. Because survival is driven by energy expenditure, your body wants to use as little energy as possible at all times, and is designed to **adapt to decrease energy usage**. It tries to be as efficient as possible, and by repeating an exercise over time (since it consumes a lot of energy), the muscles learn to perform it as efficiently as possible and it **stops triggering a growth response**. By continually changing the exercises, sets, reps, and weight used in your workouts, you can prevent the body from fully adapting to the stressor, leading to continued muscle growth.

When you notice a **plateau** in muscle growth, you can implement these ideas. For example, if you start with a bench press warm up at 215 lbs, then 3 sets at 315 lbs, you can instead perform a **drop set**, starting at 275 lbs, and going downward. This shocks the muscle by first skipping the expected warm up, but also performing a series of unexpected sets with no breaks. By changing the regular routine the muscle fibers scramble to adapt to the new stressor.

# True Failure
When working out, **failure is the key to success**. Think about it, your muscles are built to respond and adapt, and by going to failure, your muscles have the mindset of, "I wasn't able to keep up to the actions demanded of me, and I need to be prepared incase it happens again". This results in a significant increase in growth, as they are trying to keep up with the stress.

One of the ways to further the stress on your muscles, its to after muscular failure, let your form break a little, just to pump out an extra rep or two. This is effective in small quantities because it pushes your muscles harder than just regular failure.

A lot of people think they are hitting true muscular failure, but are actually leaving [reps in reserve](/muscles/training/basics/concepts#terminology). **True muscular failure** is the point where completing the movement, even with the last rep or two having imperfect form (typically intentional), becomes impossible, and your muscles can **literally no longer move the weight**.

# Intense Finisher Set
Research suggests ([Goto et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15574075/)) that performing a single set of an exercise of high reps (15-30) to **complete muscular failure** after your existing normal sets can significantly improve muscle growth. Goto et al. (2004) found that performing a single set of low-intensity and high-repetition exercise added immediately after the previous regimen without rest showed significantly larger increases in [one rep max](/muscles/training/basics/concepts#terminology) and muscular endurance compared to just the original regimen. **The muscle's cross sectional area (the size of the muscle) also increased**. This means that by adding this finisher set, you can significantly increase both muscular strength and endurance, as well as the muscle's size.
