# Terminology
- **Repetition ([Learn More](muscles/training/basics/reps-and-sets#reps-and-sets))**A repetition, or rep for short, is a single movement of an exercise. For example, a single push up is one repetition. A rep is the most basic form of measurement in weight lifting.
- **Set**A set is a group of repetitions. For example, a set would be 10 push ups performed in succession. If the reps were not performed in succession, it would typically not be a set.
- **Weight**Weight refers to the amount of resistance used in an exercise. This can be in the form of dumbbells, barbells, or even body weight.
- **Volume**Volume refers to the total amount of work performed during a workout. It is a combination of the number of sets, repetitions, and weight or resistance used in an exercise.
- **1RM**1RM, or one rep max, is the maximum amount of weight you can lift for a single repetition of an exercise. It is used to determine the amount of weight you should use for a given exercise. It is important you accurately track this, and make sure you are at true muscular failure.
