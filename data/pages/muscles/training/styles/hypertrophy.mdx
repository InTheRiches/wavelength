# Basics
Hypertrophic training, often preferred by bodybuilders, is a popular style of training that prioritizes **muscle mass over pure muscle strength**. Unlike [strength](/muscles/training/styles/strength) training, where the focus is on increasing maximal strength, hypertrophy training seeks to optimize muscle growth. There are various techniques employed to achieve this, including performing multiple sets with moderate to high rep ranges and shorter rest periods between sets. Those dedicated to hypertrophy training aim to **maximize muscle size and definition**.

Hypertrophic training puts an emphasis on [metabolic stress](/muscles/growth#metabolic-stress), which involves high intensity and time under load. You want to focus on lactic acid production while keeping the stress high. [Progressive overload](/muscles/training/info/concepts#progressive-overload) is another key factor, as it challenges your muscles to adapt and grow. These adaptations include increases in muscle CSA and the synthesis of new protein structures within the muscle tissue, increasing strength.

When training for hypertrophy, it is important to focus on **high intensity, high volume** workouts. Typically, 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps at around **85% of your 1RM** is recommended. This level of intensity places a lot of stress on your muscles, resulting in muscle gain. The emphasis is on quality over quantity, focusing on good form and full range of motion. Rest times are typically around 1-3 minutes, but can be increased to allow for sufficient recovery between sets and ensure the ability to lift with proper form. You can obviously change this to fit your needs, look into [Reps and Sets](/muscles/training/info/reps-and-sets) for more information. Hypertrophy training is built to maximize muscle growth and size, and will provide the best results if you want muscle mass and an aesthetic physique.
