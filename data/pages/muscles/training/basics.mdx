# Muscle Activation
Muscles are a dense tissue composed of anywhere from a **thousand to a million fibers**. Muscle fibers are groups of individual cells that make up muscles, and they have a unique ability to **contract** or **shorten**, resulting in movement. Think of muscle fibers as tiny "strings" that can pull on each other when they receive a signal to do so.

Muscles are activated by signals from our **nervous system**, which is like the body's electrical wiring. When we want to move, our brain sends a signal through our nervous system to the muscle that needs to contract. This signal triggers a series of **chemical reactions** inside the muscle fibers.

Your muscle fibers consist of **"strings"** (technically called filaments) of muscles that are overlapping and holding onto each other. At the most basic level, when a muscle receives a signal to contract from the nervous system, it tells all the "strings" to **pull on each other**, resulting in a **shortening** of the muscle, which pulls on the various tendons connected to bones, resulting in movement.

This process requires **energy** in the form of ATP, and it continues as long as the muscle is receiving the signal to contract. So, when you move a muscle, the tiny strings inside the muscle fibers are grabbing and pulling on each other to make the whole muscle get **shorter** and perform movement.

# Muscle Heads
Some muscles are made up of multiple "heads". These parts of the muscle attach to different bones in your body and work together to perform **movement**. For example, the biceps muscle in your upper arm has two heads - the "long head" and the "short head". These heads attach to different parts of your shoulder blade and forearm bone, respectively.

Each head of a muscle can work independently or together with the other heads of the same muscle. This means that different heads can produce different movements or help to **stabilize** joints in different ways.

For example, let's go back to the biceps muscle. The long head of the biceps attaches to a part of the shoulder blade called the "supraglenoid tubercle". This attachment point allows the long head to help **stabilize the shoulder joint** when you lift your arm. Meanwhile, the short head of the biceps attaches to the forearm bone called the "radius". This attachment point allows the short head to help flex the elbow joint when you curl your arm.

By working together, the different heads of a muscle can produce complex movements that require multiple joints to move. For example, when you lift a heavy object towards your shoulder, you're using both the long and short heads of the biceps to stabilize your shoulder joint and flex your elbow joint.

Multiple "heads" on a muscle can work together or independently to produce different movements and functions. Here are a few examples:

# Soreness
**Muscle soreness** is the feeling of discomfort or pain in your muscles that you might experience after exercising or doing physical activities. It's like when you feel a bit achy or stiff in your muscles after playing sports or doing exercise.

There are multiple reasons why you might feel sore. As mentioned before in [Muscle Growth](/muscles/growth), when your muscles are pushed during an activity like weightlifting, muscles experience stress and damage at the cellular level. This stress and damage causes inflammation, leading to that achy, sore feeling you might get. This often results in **Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness** (DOMS). It's called "delayed onset" because it doesn't happen right away. It's like when you eat something spicy, and your mouth feels fine at first, but a little while later, it starts to feel really hot. DOMS usually kick in **a day or two** after intense exercise, and only last a day or two.

Another reason is due to **lactic acid**, however that only lasts 15-20 minutes after a workout. Lactic acid is the chemical behind the "pump" feeling, which is discussed [here](/muscles/growth#metabolic-stress).
