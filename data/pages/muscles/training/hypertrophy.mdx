# Basics
Hypertrophy training, often preferred by bodybuilders, is a popular style of training that prioritizes **muscle mass over pure muscle strength**. Unlike [strength](/muscles/training/strength) training, where the focus is on increasing maximal strength, hypertrophy training seeks to optimize muscle growth. There are various techniques employed to achieve this, including performing multiple sets with moderate to high rep ranges and shorter rest periods between sets. Those dedicated to hypertrophy training aim to **maximize muscle size and definition**.

Within hypertrophy training, the emphasis is placed on muscle hypertrophy, which involves the enlargement of individual muscle fibers. When individuals engage in hypertrophy training, they subject their muscles to [progressive overload](/muscles/training/basics/concepts#progressive-overload), challenging them to adapt and grow. This adaptation process primarily involves the enlargement of existing muscle fibers and the synthesis of new protein structures within the muscle tissue. The result is an increase in muscle size and improved muscular definition, which is the desired outcome for those pursuing hypertrophy.

When training for hypertrophy, it is important to focus on **high intensity, low volume** workouts. Typically, 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps at around **85% of your 1RM** is recommended. This level of intensity places a lot of stress on your muscles, resulting in muscle gain. The emphasis is on quality over quantity, focusing on good form and full range of motion. Rest times are typically around 1-3 minutes, but can be increased to allow for sufficient recovery between sets and ensure the ability to lift with proper form. You can obviously change this to fit your needs, look into [Reps and Sets](/muscles/training/basics/reps-and-sets) for more information. Hypertrophy training is built to maximize muscle growth and size, and will provide the best results if you want muscle mass and an aesthetic physique.
