# Amino Acids
Protein is the **building block** of muscles, and its importance cannot be understated. To understand protein, you have to understand what amino acids are. Amino acids are 20 specific molecules that your body uses for dozens of functions. Their functions include:

# What is Protein?

When consumed, proteins are broken down into **amino acids** and utilized everywhere in the body, although we will be focusing on its use in  **repairing** and **building muscle tissue**. Muscle tissues are made up of fibers of protein, primarily actin and myosin. These fibers are what get pulled and contracted when your muscle activates. When you workout and put tears in these fibers, your body fills in the tear with new protein fibers, making the muscle bigger and stronger.

# Protein Intake
It is recommended to consume around **0.7-1 gram** of protein per pound of body weight daily. **Lean** (low fat) meats like poultry, fish, and dairy are great sources of protein. There are also **plant based** options available such as peanuts and soy. The only thing to consider with plant based proteins is that they are most likely not **complete proteins**.

# Complete Proteins
Proteins are made up of **amino acids**. In total, there are **20**, and your body makes **11 of them on its own**. In order to acquire the other 9, you need to eat food that contains them. If a food does not contain all 9 essential amino acids, it is considered to have **incomplete** proteins, otherwise it is has **complete** proteins. Things like nuts, vegetables and whole grains have incomplete proteins. All meats contain complete proteins, as their bodies required all 20 amino acids to function as well.

<InformationBlock content="If a food has incomplete proteins, that does not mean it should not be consumed as a source of protein. As long as the other missing proteins are consumed in other foods throughout the day, you are fine." />
