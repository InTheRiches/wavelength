# Amino Acids
Protein is the **building block** of muscles, and its importance cannot be understated. To understand protein, you have to understand what amino acids are. Amino acids are 20 specific molecules that your body uses for dozens of functions. Their functions include:

# What is Protein?

Proteins play a vital role in the body, as they are broken down into amino acids and utilized throughout various processes. In this discussion, we'll primarily focus on their importance in the context of repairing and building muscle tissue. Muscle tissues consist of a complex network of fibers, including proteins like actin and myosin, which are crucial for muscle contraction.

During physical activities such as weightlifting, muscles experience stress and damage at the **cellular level**. This triggers growth hormones and leads to an increase in the synthesis of new muscle proteins assembled from amino acids. 

If you want to know exactly how this process triggers muscle growth, refer to [muscle growth](/muscles/basics#muscle-growth).

# Protein Intake
It is recommended to consume around **0.7-1 gram** of protein per pound of body weight daily. **Lean** (low fat) meats like poultry, fish, and dairy are great sources of protein. There are also **plant based** options available such as peanuts and soy. The only thing to consider with plant based proteins is that they are most likely not **complete proteins**.

# Complete Proteins
There are 20 types of amino acids, and your body makes **11 of them on its own**. In order to acquire the other 9, you need to eat food that contains them. Since proteins are made of amino acids, consuming proteins is by far the best way to get amino acids. If a food does not contain all 9 essential amino acids, it is considered to have **incomplete** proteins, otherwise it is has **complete** proteins. Things like nuts, vegetables and whole grains have incomplete proteins. All meats contain complete proteins, as their bodies required all 20 amino acids to function as well.

<InformationBlock content="If a food has incomplete proteins, that does not mean it should not be consumed as a source of protein. As long as the other missing proteins are consumed in other foods throughout the day, you are fine." />
