# Basics

Cutting involves creating a **caloric deficit** by consuming fewer calories than your body needs to maintain its current weight. By not consuming your bodies needs, it burns fat to cover to remaining energy needed. The primary goal is to shed body fat while preserving lean muscle mass. It is typically done during the warmer months when your body is more exposed, as cutting improves **aesthetics**. Unlike bulking, where you prioritize muscle gain, during a cut, you prioritize fat loss and achieving a more defined physique.

# Dirty Cutting

Dirty cutting is a less healthy approach to cutting, where the primary focus is solely on reducing calorie intake without much concern for the quality of the food. It often involves indulging in a **restrictive diet**, low in calories, and lacking in essential nutrients. People practicing dirty cutting might resort to extreme measures like **crash diets** or excessive cardio to lose weight rapidly. Often times people will go days without eating which is highly effective, but also extremely unhealthy. While it can lead to quick weight loss, dirty cutting can have adverse effects on your overall health and may result in muscle loss. It's crucial to consult with a **healthcare professional** or **registered dietitian** if you opt for this method to ensure you're still getting essential nutrients and not compromising your health.

# Clean cutting

Clean cutting, on the other hand, emphasizes **quality over quantity**. Instead of just cutting out food in general, people on a clean cut reduce their consumption of high fat and high caloric foods, and instead eat lean meats like chicken and beef. On a clean cut, consistency is key, and the goal is long term success, as it is a healthier but slower process. 

Clean cutting is a lot harder, and requires a ton of discipline, and is only effective over a long term (> month). However, it is a healthier and more sustainable approach to losing weight, and should be your first choice when deciding how to lose weight. Although, in some scenarios, perhaps not being able to afford large quantities of lean meat, a dirty cut would be the better path. If you are unsure, consult with a **healthcare professional** or **registered dietitian**. Their advice is best as it is tailored to your specific situation.

# How to Cut

When cutting, it is recommended to consume around 300-500 calories less than your daily maintenance amount, which is typically around 2000-2500 calories for most individuals. This calorie deficit should result in an average weight loss of about 1-2 pounds per week, which is considered a safe and sustainable rate. It's crucial to combine this calorie reduction with a regular exercise routine that includes both cardiovascular workouts and strength training to preserve lean muscle mass.

> Remember that your specific caloric needs and macronutrient ratios may vary based on factors such as your age, gender, activity level, and overall health. For personalized guidance, it's always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian who can help create a cutting plan tailored to your individual needs and goals.
